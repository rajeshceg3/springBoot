# Product Requirements Document: Spring Boot Microservices Collection

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the inferred product requirements for the Spring Boot Microservices Collection. The collection appears to provide a backend infrastructure for a modular application, potentially related to banking, user management, and communication, with robust security features.

## 2. Product Vision

To provide a suite of independent, deployable microservices that together form a comprehensive platform for managing users, banking operations, and potentially other business functionalities. The architecture emphasizes security and potentially event-driven communication.

## 3. Users / Roles

*   **End Users:** (Implicit) Interact with front-end applications that consume these microservices.
*   **Administrators:** (Implicit) Manage the services, monitor health, and potentially configure aspects of the system.
*   **Developers:** Utilize and extend the microservices.

## 4. Functional Requirements

This section is based on inferences from service names and observed functionalities.

### 4.1. User Management (`user-service`, `springBoot-jwt`, `springBoot-oauth`, `springBoot-security`)
    *   FR1.1: The system must allow user registration.
    *   FR1.2: The system must allow user authentication (likely via JWT and/or OAuth2).
    *   FR1.3: The system must provide mechanisms for role-based access control.
    *   FR1.4: Secure storage of user credentials.

### 4.2. Banking Operations (`bank-service`)
    *   FR2.1: The system (bank-service) should allow for creation and management of bank accounts (details to be inferred).
    *   FR2.2: The system should allow for transactions between accounts (details to be inferred).
    *   FR2.3: The bank-service likely interacts with the user-service for customer data.

### 4.3. Asynchronous Messaging (`springBoot-kafka-producer`, `springBoot-kafka-consumer`, `springBoot-rabbitmq-producer`, `springBoot-rabbitmq-consumer`)
    *   FR3.1: The system must be able to publish messages/events to Kafka topics (e.g., movie data to 'imdb' topic).
    *   FR3.2: The system must be able to consume and process messages/events from Kafka topics.
    *   FR3.3: The system must be able to publish messages to RabbitMQ exchanges/queues.
    *   FR3.4: The system must be able to consume and process messages from RabbitMQ queues.
    *   FR3.5: These messaging systems are likely used for decoupling services and enabling event-driven architecture.

### 4.4. General API (`springBoot-restapi-crud`)
    *   FR4.1: The system provides a CRUD API interface for data management, likely interacting with a MongoDB backend. (Specific data models TBD).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1: Security:**
    *   NFR1.1: Authentication and authorization must be enforced for all relevant API endpoints.
    *   NFR1.2: Data in transit should be secured (e.g., using HTTPS).
    *   NFR1.3: Sensitive data at rest should be encrypted.
*   **NFR2: Scalability:**
    *   NFR2.1: Individual microservices should be independently scalable.
    *   NFR2.2: The system should be able to handle an increasing load by scaling out services.
*   **NFR3: Reliability & Availability:**
    *   NFR3.1: Services should be resilient to failures in other services where possible.
    *   NFR3.2: The system should aim for high availability.
*   **NFR4: Maintainability:**
    *   NFR4.1: Code should be well-structured and documented.
    *   NFR4.2: Services should follow consistent design patterns.
*   **NFR5: Performance:**
    *   NFR5.1: API response times should be within acceptable limits.
    *   NFR5.2: Message processing should be efficient.

## 6. Future Considerations / To Be Determined (TBD)

*   Specific business rules for banking operations.
*   Detailed data models for all services.
*   Error handling and logging strategies across services.
*   Deployment strategy for production environments.
*   Specific SLOs/SLIs for performance and availability.
